Create thumbnails on the fly instead of storing them on disk

== Description ==

This plugin makes Wordpress create thumbnails on the fly rather than storing multiple copies of the same image on upload.

You should use this plugin if you prefer to save disk space rather than CPU. You can save A LOT of space with this plugin. You also get a cleaner uploads folder.

Reads size from URL. You need only add -[width]x[height] to the image path (like regular WordPress thumbnails). Ex: image-100x100.jpg. Size 0 means auto. With both sizes set, it crops to the center.

WARNING: This plugin deletes all current thumbnails and stops Wordpress from generating new thumbnails to keep the uploads folder clean of unnecessary files. If you ever choose to disable this plugin, use a plugin like [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) to, well, regenerate the thumbnails.
